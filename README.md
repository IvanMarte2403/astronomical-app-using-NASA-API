# Code

Only 4 documents are important in the code 💻 the other are part of a library similar to bootstrap. If you download bootstrap in the App will be run perfect to. This documents is important for you if you want modify.
1. *index.html*
2. *style.css*
3. *parallax.js*
4. *script.js*

# Design 🖌️
I modify the vectors in photoshop to create a only attractive application and modify manualy the with
### Architecture 
The architecture made easier because i use a library similar to boostrap, making rows and cols to build the app. In some parte i implement flex-box to organize, but boostrap also includes it.
### Parallax and Animations 🌑

I love the animation of the moon is *pure css*, the challenge did the creaters and the little satelite animation´s. The parallax only read the value of windows scroll, and move all the images, the second work are the desing in Photoshop
